To add your hero background image:

1. Save your family cooking kitchen image as "hero-bg.jpg"
2. Place it in this "public" folder
3. The image will automatically appear as the background of the hero section

The image has been set up with:
- A white overlay at 85% opacity for text readability
- A gradient fade to white at the bottom
- Responsive cover sizing

If you want to adjust the opacity, edit the hero section in app/page.tsx:
- bg-white/85 = 85% white overlay (increase number for more opacity)
- bg-white/75 = 75% white overlay
- bg-white/90 = 90% white overlay (more opaque, easier to read text)
